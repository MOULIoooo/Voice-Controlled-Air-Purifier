# Voice-Controlled-Air-Purifier
# 🗣️ Voice-Controlled Smart Air Purifier

This project is a smart **Voice-Controlled Air Purifier** designed for hands-free operation. It integrates **Bluetooth voice commands**, **dual cooling fans**, and **glass fiber filters** to efficiently purify indoor air. The system is ideal for environments that require clean air with minimal user interaction.

## 📌 Components Used

- Arduino Uno / ESP32
- HC-05 Bluetooth Module
- Dual Cooling Fans (5V or 12V)
- Glass Fiber Air Filters
- Relay Module / Transistors for fan control
- Smartphone with voice control app (like Arduino Voice Control / BT Voice)
- Power Supply

## ⚙️ Working Principle

1. **User gives voice commands** (e.g., "turn on", "turn off") via a Bluetooth app.
2. The HC-05 module receives the command and sends it to Arduino.
3. Based on the command:
   - Fans are turned ON/OFF via relays or transistors.
   - LED indicators can show purifier status.
4. Air is drawn through the **glass fiber filter**, removing dust and particles.

## 🔧 How to Use

1. Upload the Arduino code.
2. Connect HC-05 Bluetooth module and fans as per the wiring.
3. Pair your smartphone with HC-05 via Bluetooth.
4. Use a voice control app to send commands like "ON" and "OFF".

## 🎤 Supported Voice Commands

- **"Turn on"** → Starts air purification
- **"Turn off"** → Stops fans
- (You can customize more commands if needed)
